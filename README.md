# Just Needed

Just Needed is a mod that aims to add the stuff that I think is "Just Needed" in Minecraft, whether it be Vanilla+ or a bit more out there.

Currently, the main features are slab/stair variants of blocks such as sand, gravel, dirt, wool, and a couple more. There is also Cooked Egg and Pumpkin soup. Some custom recipes, like for a Bell, flint from gravel, grass blocks etc.

I spent 8 hours on this porting it to multi modloader template from architectury. I am dead
